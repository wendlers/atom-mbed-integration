# Mbed Development with Atom

This package tries to add as much features as possible to Atom to help you with [mbed](https://www.mbed.com/) development.

Basically the following is available after installing this package:

* Support to compile Mbed projects (by using mbed-cli)
* Flash .hex or .bin files to your device
* See the `printf` output from your device on a serial monitor

If you use Atom on a supported system (currently only Linux x64), this package will offer to install a complete Mbed toolchain. Including `mbed-cli` and the GCC compiler for ARM.

The ultimate goal is, that the only thing you need to install to start programming for Mbed is installing this package.

Please note, that this package is in a very early alpha stage!
